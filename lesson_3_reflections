When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I use different computer or if someone wants to contribute, it is possible with this remote working

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I want to have manual control over remote repository update, because I update it only when it is ready to be updated not in the steps or branches performed for some alternatives and searches.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is copying from Github to Github. Clone is from Github to local or local to local. Branch is inside a local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To understand the real difference between the remote and last saved remote, we need that information locally.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It could be easier only online working is allowed for everyone regarding collaboration. However when local study, version control, sharing and collaboration are all considered, using Github is easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If I want to explore a new idea, try something or when I have more than one way in my mind to go I can use it. It is also good when collaborating. Branching and merging, pull requests ensure each collaborators ideas are incorporated with mutual agreement.
